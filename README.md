# Exercise-Accuracy-Detection-using-Smart-Wearables

This project aims to develop a reliable solution using smart wearables to assess exercise positions by collecting data from two wearables (wrist and ankle) to track and evaluate user performance against fitness goals.

Objectives:
1. Enhance the effectiveness and safety of workouts with consistent user progress reports.
2. Address challenges like data synchronization and algorithm creation.
3. Contribute to advancements in wearable technology.
4. Drive innovation in the field of digital health and wellness.

Algorithms Used:
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2. Random Forest
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
4. Segmentation Algorithm

Tech Stack: Python, Kotlin, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras

Frameworks and IDE: Arduino, Android Studio, BLE, SQLite
